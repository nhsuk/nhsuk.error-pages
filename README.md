# NHS.UK error pages

Repository to build simple error pages which share the same simple HTML and CSS.

These are built in Azure and pushed to blob storage for Akamai to serve when it encounters that error.

## Install

`npm install`

## Development

`npm run build` will compile the HTML files and add them to `./dist` so you can check them locally.
The `./dist` directory is not committed to the repository as a fresh build takes place within Azure pipeline

## CI

Build and release pipelines are in https://dev.azure.com/nhsuk/nhsuk.error-pages
